Things that still need doing because if I don't write them down right now I'll forget

Config
- At the end, replace hardcoded numbers in the config with calls to functions. That way the numbers are always correct.

Items
- Check whether putting them into slots and such actually works. Probably wait until items are fully functional.
- Acid powercells not accepted in the charger?
- Batteries need their stuff set at game start, not during item registering.
- Expand on Kharaa vehicle recipe costs. Only seamoth actually got any changes?
- Ensure the filterchip gets added to known tech when all leaks have been fixed.

Monos
- Complete functionality of deco module and filterchip

Patches
- Changing the Lifepod's RigidBody to enable interpolation might solve the stuttering issues caused by low physics update rate.
  Also, you can change the rate even at runtime! Time.fixeddeltatime
- Don't forget to add countdown timer to explosion
- When adding power, do not forget to add stuff from EscapePodPatcher

New Ideas
- Make tanks not refill by themselves. Refill at special point?
- Add config options for moving the GUI elements relative to top/sides/wherever.
- Self-updating score multiplier in the options menu, to show you what you'll get
- Progressively worse Kharaa infection to counteract difficulty being too frontloaded
- Explicit compatibility with some popular/well fitting mods. Like C2C, Unknown Name, Enhanced Sleep, ...
- Add game quit/reload warning on loading screen to hootils
- Introduce QoL way to get stalker teeth because YOU NEED SO MANY
- Change nuget packages.config to csproj PackageReference?
- Add some way to remove passive power drain from the scanner room. It gets really rough with the multiplier.
- Probably difficult. Partial base flooding on entry? Stoppable with bulkhead? Apparently they already do that in
  vanilla, so it could be doable.
- Draining water costs power
- Some extra stuff from RadiationChallenge? Lifepod no longer safe, that kind of thing?
- Add additional window to run stats to view all the details about a run and make the scoring more transparent.
- Vehicles move more slowly when damaged

Checks at the very end
- All items craft properly and fit into their slots
- Breathing works as it should in bases, alien bases, vehicles, open water
- No bends from precursor base elevator
- Do one huge sweep through all the Patcher classes and ensure nothing was forgotten
- Nitrogen resets on death

Substantial changes from the original
- Photosynthetic tanks always work in sunlight, including the surface
- Completely custom implementation of nitrogen without relying on the game. Some of the math and speeds is different
  as a result.
- Save data is now per save slot. Deathrun no longer messes with your vanilla saves. Should also help with 
  issues with autosave mods.
- Damage from the Aurora explosion is dealt at the time the shockwave hits you, rather than when the explosion occurs.
  Shockwave also has a physical force and damages everything else (bases, fish, ...) too.
- Much better compatibility with other mods due to less intrusive patching.
- Pacifist challenge covers many more ways to damage things.
- Re-introduces a patch that lets you deploy filterpumps from the water surface.
- Scoring system is reworked. Legacy runs can be imported, but will show different scores.

Known Issues
- Number of fragment scans not properly reflected by seaglide and constructor until first scan.
- Sometimes you get flung out of your escape pod at the beginning.
