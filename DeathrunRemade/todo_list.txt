Things that still need doing because if I don't write them down right now I'll forget

Config
- Skeleton exists, has to actually be implemented.
- Some of the options could do with separating out into two.
- Rename habitat builder to tool costs

Items
- Check whether putting them into slots and such actually works. Probably wait until items are fully functional.
- Acid powercells not accepted in the charger?

Monos
- Maybe use those in more places than the original did?

Patches
- All of them. So many.
- Reintroduce easier filterpump placement. Was commented out in BreathingPatcher

New Ideas
- Make tanks not refill by themselves. Refill at special point?
- Add config options for moving the GUI elements relative to top/sides/wherever.
- Self-updating score multiplier in the options menu, to show you what you'll get
- Progressively worse Kharaa infection to counteract difficulty being too frontloaded
- WorldForces.DoFixedUpdate has a shockwave-esque thing to apply to everything on explosion. Could transpile some damage into it too?
- DealDamageOnImpact.OnCollisionEnter can be transpiled to not allow dealing damage by ramming stuff with vehicles on Pacifist

Checks at the very end
- All items craft properly and fit into their slots
- Breathing works as it should in bases, alien bases, vehicles, open water

Substantial changes from the original
- Photosynthetic tanks always work in sunlight, including the surface
- Completely custom implementation of nitrogen without relying on the game
- Save data is now per save slot. Deathrun no longer messes with your vanilla saves. Should also help with 
  issues with autosave mods.
