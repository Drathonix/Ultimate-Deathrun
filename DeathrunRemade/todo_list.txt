Things that still need doing because if I don't write them down right now I'll forget

Monos
- Complete functionality of deco module and filterchip

New Ideas
- Make tanks not refill by themselves. Refill at special point?
- Progressively worse Kharaa infection to counteract difficulty being too frontloaded
- Explicit compatibility with some popular/well fitting mods. Like C2C, Unknown Name, Enhanced Sleep, Custom Batteries, ...
- Add game quit/reload warning on loading screen to hootils -> should probably be done by Nautilus
- Introduce QoL way to get stalker teeth because YOU NEED SO MANY
- Probably difficult. Partial base flooding on entry? Stoppable with bulkhead? Apparently they already do that in
  vanilla, so it could be doable. Vanilla seems kinda buggy though.
- Draining water costs power
- Some extra stuff from RadiationChallenge? Lifepod no longer safe, that kind of thing?
- Add additional window to run stats to view all the details about a run and make the scoring more transparent.
- Vehicles move more slowly when damaged
- Increase oxygen use with depth
- Add current score to deathrun saves?
- Replace current graphics with something else. Particularly fish samples. Add graphics to items missing them.

Checks at the very end
- Do one huge sweep through all the Patcher classes and ensure nothing was forgotten
- Do bases really get damaged by the explosion?
- Are all relevant config settings contributing to the score?
- Are all the encyclopedia tutorials accurate and up to date?

Reworks before release
- Have more than one tutorial message.
- Move encyclopedia to localisation system.
- Rework the filterchip into something that actually makes sense.
- Be consistent with which places accumulate nitrogen and which do not. Add config option for e.g. bases.
- Respect cheats everywhere. Pay special attention to damage, oxygen, and power.
- Replace the names of starts with more inventive ones. Add new ones.
  - Remove 'Dramatic View' and other non-terrain starts entirely due to collision check issues.
- Rework nitrogen UI entirely.
  - Remove bar and add grace period to safe depth hud
- Make mod fully able to function in repeated saving and loading between in-game and main menu.

Substantial changes from the original
- Photosynthetic tanks always work in sunlight, including the surface
- Completely custom implementation of nitrogen without relying on the game. Some of the math and speeds is different
  as a result.
- Save data is now per save slot. Deathrun no longer messes with your vanilla saves. Should also help with 
  issues with autosave mods.
- Damage from the Aurora explosion is dealt at the time the shockwave hits you, rather than when the explosion occurs.
  Shockwave also has a physical force and damages everything else (bases, fish, ...) too.
- Much better compatibility with other mods due to less intrusive patching.
- Pacifist challenge covers many more ways to damage things.
- Re-introduces a patch that lets you deploy filterpumps from the water surface.
- Scoring system is reworked. Legacy runs can be imported, but will show different scores.
- The scanner room does not passively drain power.
- The mod can now be translated simply by adding a localisation file to the Assets/Localization folder.

Known Issues
- Nitrogen bar starts off with the wrong value on game start.
