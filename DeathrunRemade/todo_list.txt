Things that still need doing because if I don't write them down right now I'll forget

Config
- Skeleton exists, has to actually be implemented.
- Some of the options could do with separating out into two.
- Rename habitat builder to tool costs

Items
- Check whether putting them into slots and such actually works. Probably wait until items are fully functional.
- Acid powercells not accepted in the charger?

Monos
- Maybe use those in more places than the original did?

Patches
- All of them. So many.

New Ideas
- Tanks do not refill by themselves. Refill at special point?
