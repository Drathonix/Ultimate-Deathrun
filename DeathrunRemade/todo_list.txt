Things that still need doing because if I don't write them down right now I'll forget

Config
- Skeleton exists, has to actually be implemented.
- Some of the options could do with separating out into two.
- Rename habitat builder to tool costs
- Embed the config in the save game so that it is locked in.

Items
- Check whether putting them into slots and such actually works. Probably wait until items are fully functional.
- Acid powercells not accepted in the charger?
- Expand on Kharaa vehicle recipe costs. Only seamoth actually got any changes?

Monos
- Maybe use those in more places than the original did?
- Complete functionality of deco module and filterchip

Patches
- All of them. So many.
- Reintroduce easier filterpump placement. Was commented out in BreathingPatcher
- Changing the Lifepod's RigidBody to enable interpolation might solve the stuttering issues caused by low physics update rate.
  Also, you can change the rate even at runtime! Time.fixeddeltatime
- Don't forget to add countdown timer to explosion
- When adding power, do not forget to add stuff from EscapePodPatcher

New Ideas
- Make tanks not refill by themselves. Refill at special point?
- Add config options for moving the GUI elements relative to top/sides/wherever.
- Self-updating score multiplier in the options menu, to show you what you'll get
- Progressively worse Kharaa infection to counteract difficulty being too frontloaded
- DealDamageOnImpact.OnCollisionEnter can be transpiled to not allow dealing damage by ramming stuff with vehicles on Pacifist
- Explicit compatibility with some popular/well fitting mods. Like C2C, Unknown Name, Enhanced Sleep, ...
- Add game quit/reload warning on loading screen to hootils
- Introduce QoL way to get stalker teeth because YOU NEED SO MANY

Checks at the very end
- All items craft properly and fit into their slots
- Breathing works as it should in bases, alien bases, vehicles, open water
- No bends from precursor base elevator

Substantial changes from the original
- Photosynthetic tanks always work in sunlight, including the surface
- Completely custom implementation of nitrogen without relying on the game. Some of the math and speeds is different
  as a result.
- Save data is now per save slot. Deathrun no longer messes with your vanilla saves. Should also help with 
  issues with autosave mods.
- Damage from the Aurora explosion is dealt at the time the shockwave hits you, rather than when the explosion occurs.
  Shockwave also has a physical force and damages everything else (bases, fish, ...) too.
