# Deathrun Remade

A complete rewrite of the original [DeathRun by Cattlesquat](https://github.com/Cattlesquat/subnautica) for Nautilus
and the latest version of Subnautica.

## Progress

Items that are ticked off are complete. Yellow circles mark work in progress.

The rewrite is nearing completion. A lot of things still need ironing out,
but a release can be expected by Halloween. Hope that doesn't stingray!
